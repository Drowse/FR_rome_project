  je_pontic_rivalry:0 "Outnumber Eupator's Army"
  je_pontic_rivalry_reason:0 "The Pontic Kingdom's influence has ballooned rapidly in recent decades, we must make significant territorial advances if we are to stave off our own destruction at their hands. \n\nOur first goal should be to amass an army that can stand against that of the Pontic Warlord, for his stength has been his overwhelming numbers over the native Anatolian peoples. Over time, the people will slowly arm themselves, but we can vastly speed up the process by investing in local conscription centers and barracks for the army-to-be."
